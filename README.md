# Analog-clock-2
This project is a real-time Analog Clock built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It visually represents the current system time using rotating hour, minute, and second hands â€” just like a traditional wall clock. The project showcases how CSS animations and JavaScript can work together to create dynamic, interactive UI components
